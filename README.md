# FoodFinder

## Project Overview

**FoodFinder** is a web application designed to help users locate restaurants based on their preferences and location (No GPS). The platform provides detailed information about restaurants, including reviews, menus, prices, and business hours.

- **Administrators**: Can manage user accounts, moderate reviews, and oversee platform content.

The system is built using the **MERN stack**:
- **MongoDB**: Database management.
- **Express.js**: Backend framework.
- **ReactJS**: Frontend framework.
- **Node.js**: Server environment.
